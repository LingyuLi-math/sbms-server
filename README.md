Tommy is managing this server. Contact him for inquiries: wongcht@hku.hk

## Computing guidance for labs
* For members in YH Huang lab, see [yhhuang-lab.md](yhhuang-lab.md) page.

## Login

For login via ssh, read [SSH.md](./SSH.md) page.

## Conda

Instead of installing anaconda yourself, we recommend using the shared anaconda 
platform (/opt/anaconda3). 

There is a base environment. But for specific task, create your own conda 
environment, so that you can control all versions of the packages for your 
analysis, which is important for reproducibility.
Follow the [conda manual](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to manage your environments.

## Jupyter lab on server
For connect to [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) on server, 
read [Jupyterlab.md](./Jupyterlab.md) page.

## R
For using R from conda, read [R.md](./R.md) page.
